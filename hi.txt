 Difference between http1.1 and http2.0:

HTTP 1.1:

=> Introduced in 1997.
=> Features like cors,keep alive was introduced in this update.
=> HOL - Head of Line blocking.
=> Repeatition of header data.
=> More focus on gzip,minifying,css/ts,catching etc.
=> Internet landscape was constantly changing with websites becoming more dynamic and heavy.

Drawbacks:

=> It is very difficult to use.
=> We can send only one request at a time per Tcp connection,which creates network traffic problems.
=> It supports only Text data not binary data.
=> It works only line blocking mode which creates performance problem.

HTTP 2.0:

=> Introduced in 2015.
=> Http2.0 is an Http1.1 connection with some additional features.
=> one secured Tcp connection is setup in which HTTP request are transferred in form of streams.

Features:

=> It is lightweight and heavy easy to use.
=> It supports both Text data and binary data.
=> It can be working in both block mode and non blocking mode.
=> It provides better performance and scalability when compared to http1.1

Object and its internal representation in javascript:

=> Objects are important data types in javascript.
=> Objects are different than primitive datatypes (i.e.number,string,boolean,etc...)
=> Primitive data types condition one value but objects can hold many values inform of key:value pair.
=> These keys can be variables of functions and are called properties and methods,respectively in the context of an object.
=> Every object has some property associated with some value.
=> These values can be accessed using these properties associated with them.

   var mycar = new object();
   mycar.make = 'Suzuki';
   mycar.model = 'Altros';
   mycar.year = '1998';
   mycar.wheels = '4';

=> After creating mycar object,the value inside the object can be accessed using keys.

   mycar.year

   output:1998.
